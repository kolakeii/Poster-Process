<h1>Process Work</h1>
<h2>Stage 1</h2>
<p>
    First I planned to create a web poster that is shaped like the radiation 
    <br>
    symbol, with the main text centered in the circle. The symbol itself would
    <br>
    be made out of div shapes.

<h2>Stage 2</h2>
<p>
    Instead of portraying a hostile impression of this seminar, I decided to  
    <br>
    switch to a GIF of an atom, which was procured from the internet. The
    <br>
    layout was made simple as a poster, with the negative space at the bottom
    <br>
    being reserved for the upper half of the atom gif.

<h2>Stage 3</h2>
<p>
    I decided then to comibine both ideas, creating the first radiation symbol
    <br>
    out of shape divs, while changing the colour scheme to appear less hostile
